# Solution

I went with a solution to cover off the test cases rather than a more generic option because of a couple of reasons
1. It's a 12 hour clock, there are only a fixed number of cases anyways
2. Going with a strategy pattern and taking into account point 1, there shouldn't be any need to genericise further
3. This code is more readable and efficient than the other solutions I considered
